# DATA STRUCTURE AND ALGORITHMS

This repository is documentation of a course I am taking on expanding my knowledge on data structures and algorithms. This will cover a number topics related to DS and algorithms as well as problem solving approaches and patterns.

## Big O Notation

Big O Notation is all abnout determining the performance level of a piece or pieces of code to help decide with approach to use in solve a particular problem.

Big O can be describes as the numeric representationof the performance of a piece of code.

Big O allows to us to discuss the relationship between the input of an algorithm and the output time.

### Helpful rule of thumbs in simplifying Big O Expressions

>
> > f(n) = function

> > > f(n) could be quadratic = (f(n) = n^2)
> > > f(n) could be constant = (f(n) = 1)

> Big O refers to the worst case scenario
>
> > if the number of operations is constant, regardless of the input, Big O = 1 i.e O(1) and runtime remains constant
> > if the number of operations changes or is directly proportionate to (n) or input, then the Big O is O(n) and runtime changes as input changes
> > if an operation is nested inside another operation Big O is O(n _ n) or O(n _ n \* n)
